                        <i>Celestium Life</i> is a life simulator game heavily influenced by the fantasy and sci-fi genres.
                        The in-game universe is home to several original worlds collectively called the Celestium,
                        connected by gateways called Celestium portals. Players are able to pick one of several start zones on the first available planet,
                        Anuzjaneh. From there, players can customise a character based on several races:

                        <ul>
                            <!-- <li>The Ancestrals - the oldest known race on Anuzjaneh, greated by the gods -->
                            <li>the Ancestrals</li>
                            <li>the Anaesaari</li>
                            <li>the Divjshnu</li>
                            <li>the Valeborne</li>
                            <li>the Shadowborne</li>
                            <li>the Lightborne</li>
                            <li>the Lykana</li>
                            <li>the Sian Zu</li>
                            <li>the Vyrgaan</li>
                            <li>the Vaemir</li> <!--humans-->
                    </p>

                    <p>After picking a class, players can do almost anything they want: the can explore the world,
                        find a job, and date NPCs; they can buy or rent a home, an apartment, or a room above an inn.
                        They can even attend class-specific and general academies, to earn certificates and
                        degrees to boost their chosen class and advance in the crafts that they choose.
                    </p>

                        Players can also adopt or tame pets, buy land and build businesses and homes, go to salons and spas,
                        and go shopping for clothes, furniture, groceries, and more. There are virtually no limits to how you play!
